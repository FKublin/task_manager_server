# task_manager_server
Express server for a task management app

This is the backend part of my engineering thesis project. Frontend can be found [here](https://github.com/FKublin/task_manager_expo).

The goal of this project was to create a multiplatform app allowing for tracking and management of project requirements. The server was created using the Express framework for Node.js.

To install dependencies, use `npm i`. To run the server, use `nodemon app.js`.
